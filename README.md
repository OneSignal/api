# OneSignal REST API Specification

OpenAPI Specification for OneSignal RESTFul API.  This specification powers our Client Libraries and API Reference Documentation.

## Versioning

The OneSignal API Specification file serves as the contract for users of the REST API and contains an API Version
Number.

Any changes to this API Specification or our openapi-generator fork requires at least a patch-level bump to the
spec's version number.  This version number is used to create client libraries downstream, so that API Client
Libraries have consistent semanticly versioned SDK numbering schemes between languages.
